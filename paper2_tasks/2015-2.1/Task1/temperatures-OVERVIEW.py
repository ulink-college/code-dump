#Task 1:
# A data logger records the temperature on the roof of a school twice a day, at midday and midnight.
# Input and store the temperatures recorded for a month. You must store the temperatures in two one dimensional
# arrays, one for the midday temperatures and one for the midnight temperatures. All the
# temperatures must be validated on entry and any invalid temperatures rejected. You must decide your
# own validation rules. You may assume that there are 30 days in a month.


#Getting Started - The task says:
# You must store the temperatures in two one dimensional arrays, one for the midday temperatures and one for the midnight temperatures.

# TODO:Create your arrays here:


#TODO: Add any other variables or constants you might need:

#TODO:  Add values to your lists
# How can you collect user input and add this to the list?
# You will need to do this 30 times for the task (when testing, try jsut doing this 2 or 3 times)

#TODO: Write the code here to ask the user for the temperature and then add this to the correct list and repeat

#TODO: Check that the number is with in a valid range
#       What problems might you encounter when doing this?



#TODO: Check the data validity without moving on to the next list element!

#TODO: Check your lists contain the correct data (print to the screen)
